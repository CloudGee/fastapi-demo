# ============ Key Points About the return Statement ============
"""
The return statement in get_current_user serves THREE CRITICAL purposes:

1. DEPENDENCY INJECTION VALUE:
   - The returned UserOutput object becomes the value of 'user' parameter
   - Without return, 'user' would be None
   - This is how FastAPI "injects" the authenticated user into route functions

2. AUTHENTICATION SUCCESS SIGNAL:
   - return = authentication succeeded, continue to route function
   - raise HTTPException = authentication failed, stop execution
   - FastAPI uses this to determine whether to proceed

3. DATA TRANSFER MECHANISM:
   - Passes user information from authentication layer to business logic layer
   - Enables route functions to access current user details
   - Allows for user-specific operations and logging

Without the return statement:
- Route function would receive None for user parameter
- No way to access authenticated user information
- Dependency injection would be meaningless

# ============ Request Example ============
"""
Client request:
curl -u username:password http://localhost:8000/books
or with header:
curl -H "Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=" http://localhost:8000/books

Complete flow:
1. Client sends request with Authorization: Basic xxx header
2. FastAPI detects Depends(get_current_user) in route function
3. Builds dependency tree: security -> get_db_session -> get_current_user
4. Executes dependencies in order
5. security extracts username/password from header
6. get_current_user validates credentials against database
7. If valid: returns user object -> injected into route function
8. If invalid: raises 401 exception -> route function never executes
9. Request completes: database connection automatically closed
